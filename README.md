DOTA Underlords helper app

Takes in a pre-written Python dictionary and will create a combination of heroes that will yield the maximum of the hero's main abilities. It uses a Greedy algorithm with some specific constraints to the game.

Console based, will only work with the Python dictionary of all the heroes and their abilities. Created for DOTA Underlords version 1.0 Beta build.
